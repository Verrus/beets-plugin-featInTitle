## the featuring artist is appended to the trackname field.
##
## practical use: Cleans up the arist field , so filtering per main artist is possible again.
##
## Suitable for version:
## Tested on beets version 1.1.0-beta.3

The following code needs to be placed inside the "__init_.py" file (create one if not present in ~/beets-1.0b11/beetsplug):
